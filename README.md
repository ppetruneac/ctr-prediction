# ctr-prediction

This Analysis is meant to explore the click through rate business problem and to address the following:


- build an end-to-end pipeline for the task
- showcase understanding of various aspects of ML: ETL, model building and selection, evaluation, etc.
- develop in python (jupyter notebooks) with reasonable comments
- use version control with appropriate commit messages

The analysis is about building a CTR prediction model with any of the datasets:

## Notes

Data used in this analysis is *Avazu*. Please follow the *CTR_prediction.ipynb* file where I explored the data - light EDA and conducted machine learning modelling for CTR prediction. Used a few models, compared them and at the end provided next steps for further feature engineering.
