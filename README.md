# ctr-prediction

## The Challenge 

We expect you to
  - finish the test in 2-3 hours
  - return the results in 1 week but the sooner the better
  - build an end-to-end pipeline for the task
  - showcase your understanding of various aspects of ML: ETL, model building and selection, evaluation, etc.
  - develop in python (jupyter notebooks) with reasonable comments
  - use version control with appropriate commit messages

The test is about building a CTR prediction model with one of the datasets:
  - https://www.kaggle.com/c/online-advertising-challenge-spring-2018
  - https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction
  - https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection
  - https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge

 ## Notes

 Data used in this analysis is *Avazu*. Please follow the *CTR_prediction.ipynb* file where I explored the data - light EDA and conducted machine learning modelling for CTR prediction. Used a few models, compared them and at the end provided next steps for further feature engineering. 

 To replicate run: 

 ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
